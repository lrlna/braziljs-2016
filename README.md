# Taking on Genetically Evolving Cellular Automta with JavaScript

Upcoming [ScotlandJS](https://scotlandjs.com/) Talk on Cellular Automata :dancer: 

---

## Abstract:
1. We will be looking at cellular automata. A cellular automata is a set of units governed with very simple rules. These units make up a complex system, or a model.

2. We can train cellular automata to genetically evolve, making themselves better overtime. We can make them adhere to a set of rules that would make the system reach a certain outcome at the end of N generations. We can even use these concepts in the wild.

3. We will be doing it all with JavaScript.
